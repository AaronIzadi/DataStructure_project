# Data Structures Course Project

## Description of the project:

In this project we have three types of models:
1. Student:
Fields: Name (String) , ID (int)
2. Course:
Fields: Name (String) , ID (int)
3. Grade:
Fields: Semester (int) , Grade (Double)

The goal of the project is to add, edit, delete and answering some basic questions about these models.

These questions contain of searchig through these data models and calculating the hash.

***In this project it is illegal to use the programming language's data strutures.***

## Implementation of this project:

As you can see I completely implemented the code of LinkedList, TreeSet, HashTable and Pair by myself in order to complete this project.

Also there are models, logic and repository to store the data as it was asked.
